    I know React and Vue, and also can use them with  Next.js or Nuxt.js respictivly. Have good \\
    knowledge of math, so if it is needed can develop math releated things. In addition, \\
    I know backend technologies such as Django, PHP, Node.js and can write backend \\
    using them. Of course, I am ready to learn new technologies to use them in new projects. \\

    \section{About Me}
    I started my road to the IT 6 years ago and now have 1.5 years of experience in commerce. 
    I'm proactive in problem solving and can work in team efficiently. 
    As well, I have strong skills in frontend (especially Vue and React) and can work with backend side using PHP, 
    Node.js or Python. I don't smoke and drink alcohol, and go to the gym 3 times a week. Also, 
    I have Bachalor degree in theory math, so I can implement complicated logic and analytics tools in your apps
